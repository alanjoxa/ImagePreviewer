ImagePreviewer
==============

Image preview pre-upload.

previewer.htm is a demo for, previewing the image before uploading to the server.
Eg. application:
 For the image sharing or other social networking websites like facebook, google+, a preview of the image can be shown before upload. For showing such a preview in the early days, we have to upload that image file to any of our server and get the url for it for setting that as the src of the img tag in our html.
 Now with this we can show the preview right away the user selects his file.
